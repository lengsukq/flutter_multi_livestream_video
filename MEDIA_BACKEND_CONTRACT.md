# Media Backend Contract v1

This document defines the provider-neutral HTTP contract used by
`MediaClient` / `MediaBackendClient` in
[`flutter_realtime_media_core`](packages/flutter_realtime_media_core).
It is language-neutral: a backend may be implemented in Node.js, Java, Python,
Go, .NET, or any other stack.

It is a **superset of [`BACKEND_CONTRACT.md`](BACKEND_CONTRACT.md)** (the Chime
contract v1): the same room endpoints, while provider choice is owned by the
backend. Chime-only backends keep working unchanged — see
[Chime compatibility](#chime-compatibility).

The Flutter side never receives provider API keys or secrets. Creating rooms,
signing provider tokens, and holding long-lived credentials are backend
responsibilities.

## Versioning

The current contract version is `1`.

The SDK sends this request header on contract calls:

```http
X-Media-Backend-Contract: 1
```

Compatible servers should return the same header and may include:

```json
{ "contractVersion": 1 }
```

If a supplied version is unsupported, return HTTP `400` with the standard error
body below.

## Authentication

Authentication belongs to the application. When configured with a
`tokenProvider`, the SDK sends:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <application-token>
```

This is an application token, never a provider credential. Backends with a
different scheme can use `headersProvider` instead.

## Backend provider selection

| Field | Where | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `roomMode` | create request | `meeting` or `broadcast`. New clients should send this instead of choosing a role. |
| `role` | request body | Legacy compatibility override. Modern clients omit it and let the backend assign the role from room policy. |
| `provider` | response body | Provider selected by the backend and used to issue credentials. Optional only for legacy Chime responses; when absent the SDK assumes `chime`. |
| `role` | response body | The role granted by the backend: `participant`, `host`, or `viewer`. |

Flutter never requests `livekit`, `chime`, or another provider. The backend may
choose based on deployment configuration, tenant, room policy, requested role,
capacity, cost, region, feature flags, or another server-side rule. Existing
room codes must keep resolving to the provider that owns that room.

If the server-selected provider is not configured, return
`provider-not-configured` (HTTP `503`).

## Endpoints

### `POST /rooms`

Create a room and an attendee/participant for the caller.

```json
{
  "userId": "account-123",
  "displayName": "Host A",
  "roomCode": "482913",
  "roomMode": "broadcast",
  "deviceId": "b8ae2e3f-3e30-4f66-8f69-fd63cc0cc8a5"
}
```

`roomCode` is optional (the server may generate one). Success returns a
[join response](#join-response). Recommended errors: `bad-room-code` (`400`),
`room-exists` (`409`).

`userId` is the stable logical application identity and `displayName` is
mutable presentation text. For backward compatibility, v1 servers may continue
to accept `nickname` when the newer pair is absent.

`deviceId` is optional and opaque. Demo applications may persist a random
install-scoped id and send it on create/join so the backend can treat repeated
joins from the same app installation as one logical device presence. It is not
a hardware identifier and must not contain provider credentials.

The reference backend assigns roles from `roomMode`:

- `meeting`: creator and joiners are `participant`;
- `broadcast`: creator is `host`; other devices are `viewer`;
- if the broadcast creator reconnects with the same stable `userId` or
  `deviceId`, it remains `host`.

Clients must not be able to self-promote by sending `role: "host"` on join.

### `POST /rooms/{roomCode}/join`

Create an attendee/participant in an existing room.

```json
{
  "userId": "account-456",
  "displayName": "Guest",
  "deviceId": "b8ae2e3f-3e30-4f66-8f69-fd63cc0cc8a5"
}
```

Missing room returns `room-not-found` (`404`).

For rooms created with `roomMode`, the backend ignores any valid client role
hint on join and returns the role granted by the room policy. This prevents a
viewer from changing a request field to become a host.

### Discover rooms

`GET /rooms/discover` returns lightweight room metadata for join UIs:

```json
{
  "contractVersion": 1,
  "rooms": [
    {
      "provider": "livekit",
      "roomCode": "482913",
      "roomMode": "meeting",
      "createdAt": "2026-09-24T10:00:00.000Z",
      "attendeeCount": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

Discovery intentionally excludes attendee identities and provider credentials.
It follows the same application-token protection as the other room endpoints.
Clients can refresh this list and pass the selected `roomCode` to the normal
join endpoint.

The reference demo backend keeps only the latest participant record for a
stable `userId` in a room and also collapses repeated joins from the same
`deviceId` when supplied. `participantId` remains the provider/session
identity and may change on reconnect; `displayName` may change without
creating a second logical user.

### Host room management (optional)

The reference backend exposes a provider-neutral management surface for rooms
whose assigned role model includes a `host`. Unsupported operations return
`unsupported-feature` rather than pretending a local state change affected the
provider session.

#### `POST /rooms/{roomCode}/participants`

Lists sanitized logical participants:

```json
{ "requesterParticipantId": "host-1" }
```

```json
{
  "contractVersion": 1,
  "roomCode": "482913",
  "participants": [
    {
      "participantId": "viewer-1",
      "displayName": "Viewer",
      "role": "viewer",
      "joinedAt": "2026-09-24T10:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

Do not return stable application user ids, device ids, provider credentials, or
join tokens from this endpoint.

#### `POST /rooms/{roomCode}/participants/remove`

Requests server-enforced removal of a current participant:

```json
{
  "requesterParticipantId": "host-1",
  "targetParticipantId": "viewer-1"
}
```

The reference backend currently implements native participant removal for
LiveKit. A provider without a server-side removal primitive returns
`unsupported-feature`.

#### `POST /rooms/{roomCode}/close`

Host-authorized room closure:

```json
{ "requesterParticipantId": "host-1" }
```

This differs from a normal participant `leave`: it prevents future joins and
invokes the provider room-close behavior where applicable.

For LiveKit, the reference backend calls RoomService `DeleteRoom`, which
forcibly disconnects current participants instead of only deleting the local
room-directory entry.

The account-free demo server checks that `requesterParticipantId` currently
belongs to the room host. That is demonstration-level authorization, **not
production authentication**. Production implementations must bind management
requests to the authenticated application identity/session (for example the
Bearer credential) and must not trust a caller-supplied participant id or role
by itself.

### `POST /rooms/{roomCode}/credentials/refresh` (optional)

Refresh short-lived credentials for an already admitted participant. Adapters
that support renewal call this endpoint; existing adapters and compatible
backends that do not use expiring credentials are unaffected.

```json
{ "participantId": "u-123", "role": "host" }
```

Success returns the standard [join response](#join-response). The backend must
keep `provider`, `roomCode`, `participantId`, and `role` identical to the
original session, and must authorize the caller as that application user. A
refresh response that changes any of those fields is rejected by Core. Return
`forbidden` (`403`) when the user is not authorized to refresh that participant.

### `POST /rooms/{roomCode}/heartbeat`

Best-effort presence signal, called once after joining and then every
heartbeat interval. Current clients include the logical participant id so the
backend can maintain participant-level presence:

```json
{ "participantId": "host-a" }
```

For backwards compatibility, servers may still accept an empty body as a
room-level heartbeat. A backend that tracks participant presence should return
`participant-not-found` (`404`) when a supplied participant id is no longer
registered in the room. Example success:

```json
{ "contractVersion": 1, "ok": true, "roomCode": "482913" }
```

Heartbeat failures surface on `MediaRoomSession.backendErrors` and never
terminate healthy media.

### `POST /rooms/{roomCode}/leave`

Best-effort leave notification.

```json
{ "participantId": "host-a" }
```

Servers should accept `attendeeId` as an alias so Chime-era implementations and
the generic client can share one endpoint. Implementations must make this
endpoint safe to call more than once.

### `DELETE /rooms/{roomCode}`

Optional administrative operation exposed by `MediaBackendClient.closeRoom`.
Applications are not required to expose it to ordinary clients. For providers
that bill by attendance there is nothing to release; for providers that bill by
provisioned room (for example AWS Chime) this is the "stop future joins" call.

## Join response

Common fields:

```json
{
  "contractVersion": 1,
  "provider": "livekit",
  "role": "host",
  "roomCode": "482913",
  "participantId": "host-a"
}
```

`roomCode` is required (the SDK falls back to the requested code on join calls),
`participantId` is required by adapters. Additional fields are allowed and
ignored.

### LiveKit provider block

```json
{
  "contractVersion": 1,
  "provider": "livekit",
  "role": "host",
  "roomCode": "482913",
  "participantId": "host-a",
  "livekit": {
    "url": "ws://192.168.31.8:7880",
    "token": "<short-lived-access-token>",
    "identity": "host-a"
  }
}
```

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `livekit.url` | yes | Signaling URL: `ws://<lan-ip>:7880` for a local dev server, `wss://<project>.livekit.cloud` for LiveKit Cloud. |
| `livekit.token` | yes | Short-lived JWT access token minted by the backend. |
| `livekit.identity` | no | Participant identity; must match `participantId` when supplied. |

Token requirements:

- `roomJoin: true` and `room` scoped to the provider room mapped from the
  application room code (so a leaked token cannot join another room);
- `canPublish: true` for `host`/`participant`, **`canPublish: false` for
  `viewer`**;
- `canSubscribe: true` for every role;
- `canPublishData` for chat: `true` for host/participant, configurable for
  viewers;
- `ttl` short (minutes), not the SDK default of six hours.

### Agora provider block

```json
{
  "contractVersion": 1,
  "provider": "agora",
  "role": "host",
  "roomCode": "482913",
  "participantId": "123456789",
  "displayName": "Host A",
  "agora": {
    "appId": "<agora-app-id>",
    "channelName": "media-482913",
    "token": "<short-lived-access-token-2>",
    "uid": 123456789
  }
}
```

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agora.appId` | yes | Public Agora App ID. The App Certificate is **never** returned to Flutter. |
| `agora.channelName` | yes | Provider channel mapped from the application room code. |
| `agora.token` | yes | Short-lived Agora AccessToken2 minted by the backend. |
| `agora.uid` | yes | Positive signed 32-bit Agora UID (`1..2147483647`). Its decimal string must equal `participantId`. |

The reference backend grants join/audio/video/data privileges to `participant`
and `host`. A `viewer` receives join permission but no publish-audio,
publish-video, or publish-data privilege, and the Flutter adapter joins as an
Agora audience client with all local publishing disabled.

Agora's fine-grained publish privileges are enforced by the service only when
the Agora project has the corresponding **co-host authentication** capability
enabled. Without it, the SDK still enforces the viewer role locally, but the
backend must not claim that a modified client is server-side prevented from
publishing. Production integrations that depend on this security boundary must
enable the Agora feature and verify it with a real-project E2E test.

The current Agora adapter intentionally reports `canSendData=false` for
`viewer`. Agora RTC data streams in live-broadcast mode are host-oriented;
viewer chat would require a separate safe messaging design (for example RTM)
before it can match the Core viewer contract without weakening publish roles.

### Tencent TRTC provider block

```json
{
  "contractVersion": 1,
  "provider": "trtc",
  "role": "host",
  "roomCode": "482913",
  "participantId": "u-123",
  "displayName": "Host A",
  "trtc": {
    "sdkAppId": 1400000000,
    "strRoomId": "media-482913",
    "userId": "u-123",
    "userSig": "<short-lived-user-sig>",
    "privateMapKey": "<room-scoped-permission-ticket>",
    "expiresAtMs": 1780000000000
  }
}
```

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `trtc.sdkAppId` | yes | Public TRTC SDKAppID. |
| `trtc.strRoomId` | yes | Provider room mapped from the application room code. The adapter uses string room IDs consistently. |
| `trtc.userId` | yes | TRTC identity; it must exactly equal `participantId`. |
| `trtc.userSig` | yes | Short-lived UserSig signed by the backend. |
| `trtc.privateMapKey` | yes | Room-scoped permissions signed by the backend. Enable TRTC advanced permission control for the SDKAppID so the service enforces this grant. |
| `trtc.expiresAtMs` | recommended | UserSig and PrivateMapKey expiry as Unix milliseconds. Core adapters renew before this time and re-enter with the same room and identity. |

The TRTC adapter uses the `videoCall` scene for `participant`, and the `live`
scene for `host` and `viewer`. The reference backend derives those roles from
`roomMode`, so clients joining an existing room do not choose the scene or
promote themselves.
Publisher grants include room create/join and main-stream audio/video
send/receive permissions. Viewer grants include room create/join and audio/video
receive only; they must not include audio, video, or substream publish bits.
The Flutter viewer surface also has no publish controls and reports
`canSendData=false`. Participant/host custom messages are supported. Screen
sharing, viewer messages, and audio-device enumeration are not supported by
this adapter version.

The TRTC adapter implements the optional Core credential-refresh capability.
It renews credentials before `expiresAtMs` and rejoins the same room as the same
TRTC user. The backend must verify the caller's application identity and role
before signing replacement values. Long-lived `TRTC_SDK_SECRET_KEY` values
never belong in Flutter.

### Alibaba Cloud ARTC provider block

```json
{
  "contractVersion": 1,
  "provider": "artc",
  "role": "host",
  "roomCode": "482913",
  "participantId": "u-person1",
  "displayName": "Host A",
  "artc": {
    "appId": "<public-artc-app-id>",
    "channelId": "media-482913",
    "userId": "u-person1",
    "authInfo": "<short-lived-base64-auth-info>",
    "expiresAtMs": 1790000000000
  }
}
```

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `artc.appId` | yes | Public ARTC AppID. The AppKey is never returned to Flutter. |
| `artc.channelId` | yes | ARTC channel mapped from the application room code. |
| `artc.userId` | yes | ARTC user identity; it must equal `participantId`. |
| `artc.authInfo` | yes | Short-lived, Base64-encoded single-parameter token generated by the backend. |
| `artc.expiresAtMs` | yes | Token expiry as Unix milliseconds; Core refreshes before expiry and rejoins with the same identity. |

The backend maps `meeting` rooms to `participant`/communication mode and
`broadcast` rooms to `host` or `viewer`/interactive live mode. It must keep the
provider, room, participant, and role bound during credential refresh. ARTC
tokens authenticate the app, channel, user, and expiry; they do not encode a
server-enforced viewer publishing grant. The Core viewer surface has no publish
methods and joins in viewer mode, but this does not prevent a modified client
from changing its SDK role. ARTC custom data messages require a publisher to
have an active audio or video stream; viewers can receive messages but cannot
send them through this adapter.

### Chime compatibility

A Chime-only backend may omit `provider`, `role`, and `participantId` and
return the original shape:

```json
{
  "contractVersion": 1,
  "roomCode": "482913",
  "meeting": {
    "MeetingId": "...",
    "ExternalMeetingId": "...",
    "MediaRegion": "ap-southeast-1",
    "MediaPlacement": {
      "AudioHostUrl": "...",
      "AudioFallbackUrl": "...",
      "SignalingUrl": "...",
      "TurnControlUrl": "..."
    }
  },
  "attendee": {
    "AttendeeId": "...",
    "ExternalUserId": "...",
    "JoinToken": "..."
  }
}
```

The SDK resolves a missing `provider` to `chime`. See
[`BACKEND_CONTRACT.md`](BACKEND_CONTRACT.md) for the full Chime field list; the
Chime adapter validates `attendee.AttendeeId` against `participantId` when the
common field is supplied. The current Chime adapter intentionally advertises
only `participant`; `host`/`viewer` are rejected until backend-enforced Chime
broadcast permissions are implemented.

## Local provider modes

The existing `demo-server` implements the reference multi-provider backend.
It remains the only application-backend process:

```bash
cd demo-server
npm start
```

The server listens on `http://127.0.0.1:3000` by default. Open its existing
dashboard at `/` to switch the provider used for **new rooms** between LiveKit,
Agora, and AWS Chime without restarting Flutter. Existing rooms remain bound to their
original provider. Join/heartbeat/leave/delete resolve only by room code.

For local LiveKit testing, run `bash scripts/livekit-dev.sh start`, then source
`eval "$(bash scripts/livekit-dev.sh env)"` before `npm start`. No second backend or
gateway process is required.

For Agora, set `AGORA_APP_ID` and `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` on `demo-server`.
`AGORA_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS` defaults to 600 seconds. The server uses AccessToken2
and never exposes the App Certificate. No Agora credential belongs in Flutter
or in `--dart-define` values.

The current Chime adapter guarantees meeting/`participant` rooms only. If the
server UI is switched to Chime and a client creates a `broadcast` room, the
reference server returns a typed error instead of silently falling back to
another provider.

## Error shape

```json
{
  "contractVersion": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": "room-not-found",
    "message": "The requested room was not found.",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

`details` is optional. Clients also understand the older demo shape where
`error` is a plain string.

| Code | Suggested HTTP status | Flutter `MediaBackendErrorCode` |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `unauthorized` | 401 | `unauthorized` |
| `forbidden` | 403 | `forbidden` |
| `room-not-found` | 404 | `roomNotFound` |
| `participant-not-found` | 404 | `participantNotFound` |
| `room-exists` | 409 | `roomConflict` |
| `bad-room-code` | 400 | `invalidRoomCode` |
| `unsupported-provider` | 400 | `unsupportedProvider` |
| `provider-not-configured` | 503 | `providerNotConfigured` |
| any other `4xx` | 400 | `invalidArgument` |
| any `5xx` | 500 | `serverError` |

Transport and timeout failures map to `network` and `timeout` respectively.

## Role and permission guarantees

Client-side roles are a convenience; **the backend is the security boundary**.
For the modern contract, the backend assigns the role from room mode and stable
identity instead of trusting a joiner's requested role.

- `viewer` credentials must be issued without media publish permission. The
  LiveKit adapter additionally exposes no publish method on
  `BroadcastViewerSession`, but that alone does not protect the room.
- `host` credentials must be allowed to publish audio and video.
- The server should scope each token to the requested room, keep the TTL short,
  and log/reject attempts to join a room the role was not issued for.

## Provider notes

| Provider | Room lifetime | Billing notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LiveKit (self-hosted) | Auto-created on first join; empty rooms cost nothing | No per-minute charge; you pay for the host |
| LiveKit Cloud | Same | Metered in participant-minutes; the free Build tier has hard monthly caps |
| AWS Chime | Explicitly created and must be deleted after use | Attendee-minutes bill while someone is in the meeting; delete the meeting to stop future joins |

## Backend responsibilities

A production backend owns authentication, authorization, rate limiting, room
policy, persistence, provider credential configuration, and (for Chime) AWS IAM
setup. The existing `demo-server` is a development/reference implementation
only; it is not a production deployment template.
